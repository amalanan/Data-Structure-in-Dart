##  Introduction

###  Overview

- In the stack folder, there is code for solving two challenges using Dart Stack.
- In the linkedList folder, there is code for solving four changes using Dart LinkedList
- Note: the descriptions for every code is written as comments in the above of the page

###  Challenges that were solved in this repo:

- Stacks:
    - Challenge 1: Reverse a List, Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
    - Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses, Check for balanced parentheses. Given a string, check if there are ( and ) characters, and return true if the parentheses in the string are balanced.
- Linked List:
    - Challenge 1: Print in Reverse, Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.
    - Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node, Create a function that finds the middle node of a linked list.
    - Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List, Create a function that reverses a linked list. You do this by manipulating the nodes so that theyâ€™re linked in the other direction.
    - Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences, Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list. The implementation is similar to the removeAfter method that you implemented earlier.
